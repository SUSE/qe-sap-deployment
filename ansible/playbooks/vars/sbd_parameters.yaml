# For compliance with RFC 3720 (as much as is practical), the first part of the IQN will be set as:
# iqn.<current_year>-<current_month>.<naming_authority>:<meaningful_name>
# A good example of this would be iqn:2022-08.com.suse:local:hana.cluster.sbd
# This automation will compute the first part iqn, the naming authority and meaningful name can be defined below.
# By default, the the naming authority will be set to `local.hanasbd` and the meaningful name to 'hana_sbd'

# The clients will also require an iqn and a meaningful name.
# The iqn default is local.hana01 and local.hana02
# The default meaningful names are hanadb-01 and hanadb-02
