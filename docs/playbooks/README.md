# Ansible Playbooks

The playbooks in this project are written to be executed after
`terraform apply` and in the following order:

* registration.yaml
* pre-cluster.yaml
* sap-hana-preconfigure.yaml
* cluster-sbd_prep.yaml
* sap-hana-storage.yaml
* sap-hana-download-media.yaml
* sap-hana-install.yaml
* sap-hana-system-replication.yaml
* sap-hana-system-replication-hooks.yaml
* sap-hana-cluster.yaml

This README describes what each playbook seek to achieve and the inputs
required.

## Idempotency

Ideally all playbooks in this project should be written to be idempotent,
but not all of them are: sap-hana-install is not idempotent yet.
The playbooks are intended to be run on freshly created systems
which have not been manually managed.
If run against manually configured systems, then some plays may not act as expected.

## registration

Target hosts:

* all

Variables:

* use_suseconnect
* reg_code
* email_address
* sles_modules

Variable Source = from the command line in the conf.yaml

The 'registration' playbook registers the SLES for SAP installations with SCC.
The playbook will check for the existence of repositories available to zypper.
If repos are found, the playbook assumes registration is not required and
quits.

If no repos are found, the playbook will first attempt to register with SCC
using `registercloudguest`. If the command is available, it will be used for
registration. If `registercloudguest` is not available then `SUSEConnect` will
be used.


There's a task allowing register additional modules that require a dedicated regcode.
The module names and regcodes can be provided in the `ansible-playbook` command line as list of hashes (named sles_modules).

The format should be like this:

```
create:
    - registration.yaml (.......other variables here......) -e sles_modules='[{"key":"<module1>","value":"<regcode1>"},{"key":"<module2","value":"<regcode2>"}]'
```

## pre-cluster

Target hosts:

* all

Variables: N/A

Variable Source = N/A

The pre-cluster playbook performs a number of simple tasks that need to be
completed before the HANA clustering can commence. No variables need to
be set for this playbook.

Firstly, the playbook ensure that the `/etc/hosts` on each system contains
a valid entry for all other hosts.

After this first step the rest of the plays are only conducted on the `hana`
node group. A ssh key-pair is created (if one doesn't already exist) for the
root user. The root public key for each hana node is inserted into the
`/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. Finally, a command is run from each host to
each target (including itself) to accept the keys.

## sap-hana-preconfigure

Target hosts:

* hana

Variables:

* use_sapconf
* use_sap_hana_sr_angi

Variable Source = ./vars/hana_vars.yaml that can be populated by ansible::hana_vars in the conf.yaml

The 'sap-hana-preconfigure' playbook is used to tune the HANA nodes for
SAP HANA. It will install any additionally required packages and then
attempt to tune the OS for HANA. If the variable `use_sapconf` is true, then
sapconf will be used to tune the installation. If `use_sapconf` is not set or
is set to false, not tuning will take place. In the future the system will
be tuned by saptune by default.

## cluster_sbd_prep

Target hosts:

* hana
* iscsi

Variables:

* config_backstore_name
* config_server_iqn_name_authority
* config_server_meaningful_name
* config_client01_iqn_name_authority
* config_client02_iqn_name_authority
* config_client01_meaningful_name
* config_client02_meaningful_name
* sap_storage_dict

Variable Sources:

* ./ansible/playbooks/vars/sbd-parameters
* ./ansible/playbooks/vars/iscsi-storage-profile.yaml

The cluster_sbd_prep playbook sources three task files which performs
the following tasks:

* Configures iscsi server and exports LUNs to the HANA nodes
* Configures iscsi clients and logins in to the iscsi targets
* Discovers the iscsi disks, creates SBD devices and configures the
configuration file

All of the task files are designed to independent from each other and can be
run in isolation using tags.

The variables for this playbook that start with `config_` are optional. They
are mostly the names of the iscsi devices that will be created. If the
variables are empty, defaults will be used. The exception is sap_storage_dict.
This variable must be set, however, the default values in
./ansible/playbooks/vars/iscsi-storage-profile.yaml will be suitable unless
significant changes have been made to the iscsi Terraform configuration.

The iscsi server tasks will ensure that the correct packages are installed and
remove any packages that are known to conflict with these. It then ensures
that the iscsi services are enabled and running. The playbook then creates an
LVG, LV and file system which is to be used to store the iscsi LUN. The file
system is mounted and added to `/etc/fstab`. Finally, the iscsi LUN is
created and ACLs are added to allow the clients to access the LUN.

The iscsi client tasks first ensure that the client iscsi initiators match the
created ACL on the server. If changes are made to the initiator files, the
iscsi service will be restarted. Following this, the clients will scan the
server for and attempt to login. The discovered system will be configured
so that the discovered disks will be automatically logged into every time the
system boots.

The sbd client task file is will search for ALL discovered iscsi disks and
attempt to add these to the SBD configuration. Before creating SBD devices,
the code will attempt to dump the SBD info from the discovered disks. If
this fails, the code assumes that it is safe to use the disk. If an SBD
header exists on the disk, a new one will not be attempted. Finally,
all discovered iscsi disks will be added to the configuration file
(/etc/sysconfig/sbd) along with the other required settings.

## sap-hana-storage

Target hosts:

* hana

Variables:

* sap_storage_dict

Variable Sources:

* ./ansible/playbooks/vars/hana_storage_profile.yaml

The sap-hana-storage playbook is responsible for creating the LVGs, LVs and
file systems required by SAP HANA. This playbook consumes the `sap_storage`
role. This role has temporarily been copied into this project. In a future
release this will be removed and pulled at runtime using `ansible-galaxy`.

This playbook requires the variable sap_storage_dict. A standard variable
is automatically sourced from
`./ansible/playbooks/vars/hana_storage_profile.yaml`. This only needs to
be altered if the default terraform is not used.

## sap-hana-download-media

Target hosts:

* hana

Variables:

* hana_urls

Variable Sources:

* ./ansible/playbooks/vars/hana_storage_profile.yaml

In order to install HANA, the media must be presented. This playbook downloads
from a url. It is this users responsibility to provide urls for the following:

* SAPCAR for x86_64 Linux - this must be named SAPCAR.EXE!
* SAP HANA Server 2.0 SAR file

Other SAR files may also be added and these will automatically be installed.

The URLS must be placed into a list named `hana_urls` in
`./ansible/playbooks/vars/hana_storage_profile.yaml`. The file should be
similar to this example:

```yaml
hana_urls:
 - https://myazurestorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/sapblobs/SAPCAR.EXE
 - https://myazurestorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/sapblobs/IMDB_SERVER20_062_0-80002031.SAR
 - https://myazurestorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/sapblobs/IMDB_CLIENT20_012_25-80002082.SAR
```

The playbook simply downloads all of the urls to /hana/shared/install where
they are later consumed by the install.

## sap-hana-install

Target hosts:

* hana

Mandatory variables:

sap_hana_install_software_directory
sap_hana_install_master_password:
sap_hana_install_sid:
sap_hana_install_instance_number:
sap_domain:
primary_site:
secondary_site:

Variable Sources:

* ./ansible/playbooks/vars/hana_vars.yaml

The sap-hana-install playbook, like the sap-hana-storage playbook, uses an
external role. The playbook consumes the role to install HANA on both
HANA nodes. The minimal configuration example is pre-populated in the supplied
vars file `./ansible/playbooks/vars/hana_vars_example.yaml`. This file can be
used as a template for `./ansible/playbooks/vars/hana_vars.yaml`, which must be
present! The vars is sourced by various playbooks and contains more fields
than are strictly necessary for just installing HANA. However, this vars file
is sourced by multiple playbooks and enables system replication and clustering.
By having the HANA vars in a single file, consistency is assured across the
playbooks that rely on HANA related variables.

## sap-hana-system-replication

Target hosts:

* hana

Mandatory variables:

sap_hana_install_software_directory
sap_hana_install_master_password:
sap_hana_install_sid:
sap_hana_install_instance_number:
sap_domain:
primary_site:
secondary_site:

Variable Sources:

* ./ansible/playbooks/vars/hana_vars.yaml

The sap-hana-system-replication playbook configures SAP system replication
across two HANA nodes.  Like the sap-hana-install playbook, it requires
the `./ansible/playbooks/vars/hana_vars.yaml` vars file.  The playbook
will ensure backups exists of all primary databases and then configure
HANA System Replication. Again, this playbook uses an external role
provided by the SAP Linux Lab.

## sap-hana-system-replication-hooks

Target hosts:

* hana

Mandatory variables:

sap_hana_install_software_directory
sap_hana_install_master_password:
sap_hana_install_sid:
sap_hana_install_instance_number:
sap_domain:
primary_site:
secondary_site:

Variable Sources:

* ./ansible/playbooks/vars/hana_vars.yaml

Following the system replication playbook, it is necessary to install and
configure the system replication hooks. This playbook performs the steps
required to ensure the hooks are installed and that `sudo` is correctly
configured.  Like the previous two playbooks, this one also uses the
`hana_vars.yaml` vars file for consistency.

## sap-hana-cluster

Target hosts:

* hana

Mandatory variables:

sap_hana_install_software_directory
sap_hana_install_master_password:
sap_hana_install_sid:
sap_hana_install_instance_number:
sap_domain:
primary_site:
secondary_site:

Variable Sources:

* ./ansible/playbooks/vars/hana_vars.yaml

The sap-hana-cluster playbook is a complicated one.
The playbook can currently create clusters using either of
two fencing types: SBD or native fencing. The table
below shows which are clouds are currently supported.

| Type | SBD Fencing | Native Fencing |
|---|---|---|
| AWS | Yes | No |
| Azure | Yes | Yes |
| GCP | Yes | No |

Like the other playbooks that are directly connected to HANA operations,
this playbook also sources `hana_vars.yaml` for consistency. By default,
an SBD based cluster will not be created.

### Azure native fencing

To use Azure native fencing you must:

* Be using the azure provider in terraform
* **Provide the following variables:**
  * identity_management - 'msi' or 'spn'
  * spn_application_id - SPN fencing app id
  * spn_application_password - Password used for SPN based fencing
* **Variables below are provided by terraform output:**
  * subscription_id
  * resource_group
  * tenant_id

The five additional variables all relate to the SAP fencing application
that needs to be created. At this point, the creation of the fencing
application is not automated. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/high-availability-guide-suse-pacemaker#create-azure-fence-agent-stonith-device)
to create the fencing application.
